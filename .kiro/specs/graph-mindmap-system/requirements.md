# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build an enhanced NotebookLLM-style interactive mindmap system that leverages graph representation learning to transform raw text input into an explorable, visual knowledge graph. The system will extract concepts and relationships from unstructured text, display them as an interactive mindmap, and provide intelligent features including node expansion, relationship explanations, Q&A functionality, and voice-over narration. The deliverable is designed for a hackathon with emphasis on originality of graph use, LLM integration, UI/UX polish, and reproducibility via Docker.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Text Input Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input raw text (notes, transcripts, paragraphs) into the system, so that I can transform unstructured information into a structured graph representation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits text input THEN the system SHALL accept text of varying lengths (minimum 100 characters, maximum 50,000 characters)
2. WHEN text is submitted THEN the system SHALL sanitize input to prevent injection attacks and remove potentially harmful content
3. WHEN text is submitted THEN the system SHALL parse and extract key concepts as graph nodes using NLP techniques
4. WHEN concepts are extracted THEN the system SHALL identify relationships between concepts as graph edges with confidence scores
5. WHEN the graph is constructed THEN the system SHALL store the graph structure with nodes containing concept metadata (name, description, context, source text references)
6. IF the input text is empty or below minimum length THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message to the user
7. IF the input text exceeds maximum length THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the character limit
8. WHEN text contains special characters or multiple languages THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the parsing process
9. WHEN duplicate text is submitted THEN the system SHALL detect it and either merge with existing graph or create a new version

### Requirement 2: Graph Structure Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically convert my text into a meaningful graph structure, so that I can visualize the relationships between concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is processed THEN the system SHALL create nodes representing main concepts with unique identifiers
2. WHEN nodes are created THEN the system SHALL establish directed or undirected edges representing relationships between concepts with edge weights indicating relationship strength
3. WHEN the graph is generated THEN the system SHALL organize nodes hierarchically with main concepts at the top level and supporting concepts at lower levels
4. WHEN relationships are identified THEN the system SHALL assign relationship types (e.g., "is-a", "part-of", "related-to", "causes", "contradicts", "supports"), ensuring adherence to a predefined graph schema
5. WHEN the graph structure is complete THEN the system SHALL persist it in a graph database or structured format for efficient retrieval and manipulation
6. WHEN multiple concepts have similar meanings THEN the system SHALL detect and merge duplicate or highly similar nodes to avoid redundancy
7. WHEN the graph contains isolated nodes THEN the system SHALL either connect them to the main graph or flag them for user review
8. WHEN the graph exceeds a complexity threshold (e.g., >100 nodes) THEN the system SHALL apply clustering algorithms to group related concepts
9. WHEN graph generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with context and provide a fallback simple structure
