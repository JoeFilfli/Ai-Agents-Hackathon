# PDF Upload Feature - Setup Guide

## Overview

Your Interactive Mindmap app now supports uploading **PDF files** to extract text automatically! This allows you to analyze documents without manually copying text.

## Features

âœ… **PDF Upload** - Upload PDF documents and extract all text  
âœ… **File Validation** - Automatic type and size validation  
âœ… **No Minimum Length** - Extracted text has no character minimum  
âœ… **Error Handling** - Clear error messages for troubleshooting  

## Supported File Types

- **PDFs**: `.pdf` only

**File Size Limit**: 10MB maximum

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `pypdf==5.1.0` - For PDF text extraction
- `python-multipart==0.0.9` - For file upload handling in FastAPI

### 2. Restart Backend

Restart your FastAPI backend to load the new dependencies:

```bash
python start_backend.py
```

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
python start_backend.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Upload a PDF File

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click the **"Upload PDF"** button
3. Select your PDF file
4. The text will be extracted automatically and appear in the text area
5. Click **"Generate Knowledge Graph"** to process

### 3. Or Paste Text Manually

You can still paste text manually as before. The file upload is an additional option.

## API Endpoints

### File Extraction Endpoint

```
POST /api/py/file/extract
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Request:
- file: (binary PDF file upload)

Response:
{
  "text": "Extracted text content...",
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "file_type": "pdf",
  "char_count": 1234
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to extract text from PDF"

**Possible causes**:
- PDF is encrypted or password-protected
- PDF contains only images (scanned document)
- PDF is corrupted

**Solutions**:
- Remove password protection from PDF
- For scanned PDFs (images), use OCR software to convert to text first
- Try a different PDF file

### "Unsupported file type"

**Problem**: You're trying to upload a non-PDF file.

**Solution**: Only PDF files (`.pdf`) are supported. Convert your document to PDF first.

### "File too large"

**Problem**: File exceeds 10MB limit.

**Solution**: 
- Compress your PDF (many online tools available)
- Split large documents into smaller parts

## Technical Details

### PDF Extraction

Uses `pypdf` library to read PDF files and extract text from each page. Works with:
- Text-based PDFs
- PDFs with selectable text
- Multi-page documents

**Note**: Does NOT work with:
- Scanned PDFs (images only)
- Encrypted/protected PDFs
- PDFs with only images

### Security Features

- File type validation (MIME type and extension)
- File size limit (10MB)
- Secure file handling (no files saved to disk)
- Error sanitization

## Character Requirements

### Manual Text Entry
- **Minimum**: 100 characters required
- **Maximum**: 50,000 characters

### PDF Upload
- **Minimum**: No minimum! Any amount of extracted text is valid
- **Maximum**: 50,000 characters

This makes it easy to process PDF documents with varying amounts of text content.

## Next Steps

Once text is extracted from your PDF:
1. The text appears in the text area
2. You can edit it if needed
3. Click "Generate Knowledge Graph"
4. The system processes the text as usual

Enjoy analyzing PDFs! ðŸ“„âœ¨
